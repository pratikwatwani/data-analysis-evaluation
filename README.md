# <h1 align="center">FETCH DATA ASSESSMENT</h1>
This repository contains the assessment tasks completed for the Senior Data Analyst role at Fetch. The goal of the assessment is to demonstrate how I reason about data and communicate my understanding of a specific dataset to others.

The assessment consists of 4 tasks 📋

### Task 1: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
This folder contains the analysis of the raw data files provided - Receipts, User, and Brand. The objective for this task was to design an ER model.

The folder includes:
1. **Physical ER Diagram** - this file provides a visual representation of the physical data model.
2. **ER Model Documentation** - detailed documentation explaining the model, as well as considering the understanding and assumptions.

### Task 2: Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder
This folder contains the SQL queries written to answer the specific business questions asked in the assessment requirements. Following are the questions:

1. Top 5 brands recent month.sql
2. Top 5 Brand Recent vs Previous.sql
3. Average Spend.sql
4. Top Items Purchased.sql
5. Top Brand Spend.sql
6. Brand with most Transactions.sql

### Task 3: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
For this task, I used Python to identify at data quality issues. Although this is not an exhaustive analysis of the data, it provides a solid foundation to build on and continue quality analysis. 

The folder includes:
1. **Data_Quality_Assessment.ipynb** - this jupyter file provides the analysis conducted for this task + also includes some initial and basic EDA
2. **Data Quality Assessment.pdf** - a brief overview of the assessment results including assumptions and considerations if any.

### Task 4: Communicate with Stakeholders
This final task is to construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who isn’t familiar with the day to day work. 

The folder includes:
1. **Communication with the stakeholders - Email draft.pdf** - this consists of a sample email template to be sent out to the product manager or business leaders.
